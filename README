# materials_interface
## Authors

## Motivation
materials_interface is a Python 2 or 3 program used for automated enumeration of solid/surface/adsorbate systems for simulation initial inputs. 

## Usage
Currently materials_interface is just a collection of useful functions, probably the most useful ones are in the enumerate_adsorption.py module,
these can me used to automatically generate all possible adsorption configurations in bulk metals or on a metal surface. There are also functions 
for enumerating vacancies, generating adsorbate "paths" (e.g. adsorbates in a linked pattern), and visualization.
